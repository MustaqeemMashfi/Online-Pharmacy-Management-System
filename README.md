## 🏥 About ZenPharma

**ZenPharma** is a comprehensive **Console-Based Pharmacy Management System** developed in C. It provides a complete solution for managing an online pharmacy with three distinct user portals:

- **Admin Portal** – Full control over products, orders, and pharmacy information
- **Customer Portal** – Browse products, manage cart, place orders, and give feedback
- **Deliveryman Portal** – View assigned orders and update delivery status

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of **file handling**, **data structures**, **user authentication**, and **transaction management** in C programming.
